# Branches
This short document describes the purpose of each branch and how they should be properly used.

## Prototype
This branch is designed for prototyping.
The prototype development is done in NodeJS for simplicities sake.
When a prototype is done and ready for proper implementation it is then rewritten from scratch in C++ within the ``dev`` branch.

## Dev
This branch is where new features are implemented into this langauge written in C++

## Master
This branch includes docs that need to exist within all branches as well as the last stable version of the dev branch
